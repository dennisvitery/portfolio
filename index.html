      <h2>About Dennis</h2> 

      <p>I was born in Dallas, Texas. I spent most of my life there up until the age of 16 when my family and I moved to Mexico for some years. There I finished high school, got into college with a scholarship where I studied Industrial and Systems Engineering.</p>

      <p>I didn't get to finish my studies since we decided to move back due to the escalating drug cartel violence that started to occur at that time.</p>

      <p>I am so happy to have started this path with Thinkful and to finally have decided to get back into Computer Programming.</p>

      <p>Looking to become a well rounded and very skillful developer.</p>
